**You can skip this part if you're already familiar with C#, if not, follow along.**

Even if you've never touched C#, you will find the syntax really similar to C++ so you won't be THAT lost, don't worry.

There are a lot of great resources to start learning the basic syntax, I'll link them below, your first task of the day is then to complete these differents little exercises. Once you're done with them you should already have a better understanding of the tools you'll be working with later on.
